Investigate and approach different machine learning model to forecast whether a customer will file a claim or not.
Using supervised, unsupervised algorithms performed predictive task, Pre-processing data and data visualization, fitting model based on past data of customers and get high accuracy.
Predict the claim's values using linear regression and calculate the confusion matrix and cross- validation score and generate accuracy of the model
